# firebase-emulator-warning-reproduction

Minimal reproduction for https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues/1489

In the GitHub Action:

- set Node version with `asdf` and ensure running `node --version` in a later step produces the version set by `asdf`
- `firebase emulators:exec ...` runs and prints
	```
	âš   Your requested "node" version "10" doesn't match your global version "12"
	```
- Node 12.19.0 is the default for the GitHub Action runner I am using (ubuntu-latest as seen here - https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2004-README.md)

The emulator runs, but I am unsure if the code is actually running in Node 12 or if this is a just a logging and detection error :shrug:
